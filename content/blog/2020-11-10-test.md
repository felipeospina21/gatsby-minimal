some test

Since next.js does not have built-in solutions for active link styling, I spent some time looking for a concise way so implement it. This is the best one I've found so far. The code is written in typescript, but you can delete the types if you don't want to bother with the types.

## How to Use it
Just replace `Link`s with `NavLink` and pass in `activeClassName` as a prop and style the link with whatever `activeClassName` is.
